Overview {#overview .unnumbered}
========

Data Science and Big Data Analytics are exciting new areas that combine
scientific inquiry, statistical knowledge, substantive expertise, and
computer programming. One of the main challenges for businesses and
policy makers when using big data is to find people with the appropriate
skills. Good data science requires experts that combine substantive
knowledge with data analytical skills, which makes it a prime area for
social scientists with an interest in quantitative methods. This course
integrates prior training in quantitative methods (statistics) and
coding with substantive expertise and introduces the fundamental
concepts and techniques of Data Science and Big Data Analytics.

Typical students will be Masters and PhD students from any field
requiring the fundamentals of data science or working with typically
large datasets and databases. Practitioners from industry, government,
or research organisations with some basic training in quantitative
analysis or computer programming are also welcome. Because this course
surveys diverse techniques and methods, it makes an ideal foundation for
more advanced or more specific training. Our applications are drawn from
social, political, economic, legal, and business and marketing fields,
rather than engineering or other sciences.

Objectives {#objectives .unnumbered}
==========

This course aims to provide an introduction to the data science approach
to the quantitative analysis of data using the methods of statistical
learning, an approach blending classical statistical methods with recent
advances in computational and machine learning. We will cover the main
analytical methods from this field with hands-on applications using
example datasets, so that students gain experience with and confidence
in using the methods we cover. We also cover data preparation and
processing, including working with structured databases, key-value
formatted data (JSON), and unstructured textual data. At the end of this
course students will have a sound understanding of the field of data
science, the ability to analyse data using some of its main methods, and
a solid foundation for more advanced or more specialised study.

The course will be delivered as a series of morning lectures, followed
by lab sessions in the afternoon where students will apply the lessons
in a series of instructor-guided exercises using data provided as part
of the exercises. The course will cover the following topics:

-   an overview of data science and the challenge of working with big
    data using statistical methods

-   how to integrate the insights from data analytics into knowledge
    generation and decision-making

-   how to acquire data, both structured and unstructured, and to
    process it, store it, and convert it into a format suitable for
    analysis

-   the basics of statistical inference including probability and
    probability distributions, modelling, experimental design

-   an overview of classification methods and related methods for
    assessing model fit and cross-validating predictive models

-   supervised learning approaches, including linear and logistic
    regression, decision trees, and naive Bayes

-   unsupervised learning approaches, including clustering, association
    rules, and principal components analysis

-   quantitative methods of text analysis, including mining social media
    and other online resources

Prerequisites {#prerequisites .unnumbered}
=============

An introduction to quantitative methods at any level would serve as a
very useful foundation for this course, although no formal prerequisites
are required. Familiarity with computer programming or database
structures is a benefit, but not formally required.

Preparing before the course {#preparing-before-the-course .unnumbered}

**Kenneth Benoit** is Professor of Quantitative Social Research Methods
at the Department of Methodology, LSE. With a background in political
science, his substantive work focuses on political party competition,
political measurement issues, and electoral systems. His research and
teaching is primarily in the field of social science statistical
applications. His recent work concerns the quantitative analysis of text
as data, for which he has developed a package for the R statistical
software.

**Dr. Slava Mikhaylov** is a Senior Lecturer in Quantitative Methods at
UCL and has been teaching quantitative methods at UCL Political Science
department for the last five years. He’s currently involved in an ESRC
Big Data infrastructure investment initiative – Consumer Data Research
Centre at UCL. One of Slava’s responsibilities in the Centre is
development and provision of big data analytics training for academic
and professional community (data users). In addition Slava Mikhaylov is
deputy director of UCL Q-Step Centre, an ESRC-funded initiative to
promote quantitative methods.

**Dr. Paul Nulty** will serve as the lab assistant for this course.
